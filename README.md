# Unexpected Error Handling in Dart's try-catch

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error related to exception handling in Dart using `try-catch` blocks and the `rethrow` keyword. The issue lies in scenarios where `rethrow` doesn't provide sufficient context for debugging, leading to unexpected behavior and difficulties in tracing the error's origin.

## The Problem

The provided `bug.dart` file showcases a `fetchData` function that fetches data from an API. While the `try-catch` block handles exceptions, the `rethrow` statement might not provide a clear error message at a higher level, making debugging challenging.

## The Solution

The solution in `bugSolution.dart` improves the exception handling by including more descriptive error messages, providing better context for debugging and allowing for more granular error handling based on exception type. This example illustrates how to capture and re-throw exceptions with more specific details, leading to improved debugging and maintainability.
